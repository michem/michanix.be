# Blogdown

As one of the main languages I work with is R, why not build the whole website in R? Thanks to the fantastic work of Yihui Yue, author of the blogdown library and the standard work. 

The resource used to get started is the blogpost <https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/>. 

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```

# Deploying 

The website is deployed on DigitalOcean. To get up and running quickly with blogdown, I used the article by Colin Quirk: <https://colinquirk.com/blogdown-on-digitalocean/>.

Added https using <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04>.

The site is linked to github and updates every hour using cron.
